# Android App

This directory will contain the Android client. Planned features:

- Connect to the PC server over HTTP/WebSocket.
- Toggle auto‑accept and (optionally) queue controls.
- Display notifications for queue state changes.

## Next Steps

- Scaffold a Kotlin Android Studio project.
- Implement network layer (OkHttp/WebSocket).
- Add encrypted storage for server token/IP.
